## neural_engine

### description

this project aims at experimenting with using neural networks as game engine.
for the moment breakout is done using ASCII, however if breakout is possible next target will be mario with the addition of a diffusion model for the graphics.

non-working for the moment as the movement of the paddle is not currently handled by claude 3.5 however i'm pretty sure that with better prompting something could work.

pr are welcomed!

### todo

- make sure prompt is correct w.r.t. index, size, etc...
- improve reliability of output:
    - try other format of representation for the output of the model
    - try advanced prompting techniques if still not working
    - look into other models
